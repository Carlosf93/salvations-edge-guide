                            Resonant plates are the co-op mechanic used to generate resonance on the first three encounters of the raid.
                        </p>
                        <hr>

                            <li>To generate resonance we will always use two resonant plates: a <span class="yellowinf">Starting plate</span> and a <span class="yellowinf">Closing plate</span>. Both assigned to one fireteam member each</li>
                            <li>The Starting plate and the Closing plate are connected by a dark orange wire</li>
                            <li>A pair of plates will be deactivated by default at the start of every encounter. The condition to activate them will depend on the encounter</li>
                            <li>When a pair of plates is activated the Starting plate will have an orange glow</li>
                        </ul>
                        <hr>
                        <h4>Plates Mechanics</h4>
                        <p>
                            Stepping on an activated <span class="yellowinf">Starting plate</span> will send the orange glow via the wire to the <span class="yellowinf">Closing plate</span>.
                            <br><br>
                            When the glow reaches the <span class="yellowinf">Closing plate</span> a shrinking orange glow circle will appear. Stepping on the plate before the circle completely shrinks will start a <span class="yellowinf">Plate Chain</span> and send the glow back to the <span class="yellowinf">Starting Plate</span>, which will now act the same as the <span class="yellowinf">Closing Plate</span> when the glow reaches it.
                            <br><br>
                            For every correctly (before the circle closes) stepped on plate a <span class="yellowinf">Set of Resonance</span> will spawn. The amount and type of resonance in a <span class="yellowinf">Set of Resonance</span> are different for every encounter. Three <span class="yellowinf">Sets of Resonance</span> is the max amount of resonance needed for an encounter.
                            <br><br>
                            Stepping too early (before the glow reaches the plate) or too late (after the circle completely shrinks) onto a plate will break the <span class="yellowinf">Plate Chain</span>. 
                            <br><br>
                            The consequence of breaking a <span class="yellowinf">Plate Chain</span> is different for every encounter.

                            <li>To close a conductor a guardian needs to shoot the glowing resonance inside the conductor while having at least x1 resonance stack.

                    The large central room has a resonant chest at the beginning of the encounter and a door on each wall and in each corner that leads to one of the smaller rooms.

                    When every fireteam member is in the center room all the doors leading to the smaller rooms will close. If someone picks up the triangle resonance and dunks it in the resonant chest, the chest will despawn, a triangle witness arm will spawn, and the encounter starts. 
                    <br><br>
                    Two of the doors will open, one in a wall and the other in a corner of that same wall. Vex suplicants will come out of the rooms those doors lead to.
                    The <span class="red">Wall Team</span> will enter the the room that the wall door leads to, and the <span class="green">Corner team</span> will enter the room the corner door leads to. These two doors will close.
                    <br><br>
                    The teams will be moving in opposite directions clearing all the ads inside their rooms and helping the other team progress.
                    When one of the teams (Team A) kills a vex <span class="blue">minotaur</span> in their room a vex <span class="blue">hydra</span> will spawn in the room the other team (Team B) is in. When Team B kills that <span class="blue">hydra</span> the door that Team A needs to progress through will open.

                    Eventually one of the teams will have an <span class="yellow">Overload Champion</span> spawn in one of their rooms, the earliest a team can find the <span class="yellow">Overload Champion</span> is the third room. If that team is too slow to kill it, the other team will have their <span class="yellow">Overload Champion</span> spawn in their fourth room.
                    <br><br>
                    When the <span class="yellow">Overload Champion</span> is dead all the doors that lead to the center room will open and a <span class="yellow">Boss Tormentor</span> will spawn in it. Killing the <span class="yellow">Tormentor</span> will activate the plate in the room the <span class="yellow">Overload Champion</span> was killed, this is the first of two <span class="yellow">Starting Plates</span> we need to complete one cycle of the encounter. The <span class="yellow">Closing Plate</span> that pairs with that <span class="yellow">Starting Plate</span> will be in one of the rooms connected to it by wires, next to an active <span class="yellow">Resonant Conductor</span>.
                    <br><br>
                    Killing the <span class="yellow">Tormentor</span> will also close all the doors again and a new set of two doors (Wall and Corner) will open. Both teams will repeat the same process to progress through the rooms, killing <span class="blue">minotaurs</span>, <span class="blue">hydras</span> and eventually the <span class="yellow">Overload Champion</span>. The team that does not spawn the <span class="yellow">Overload Champion</span> first (the one that would spawn it in their fourth room instead of their third) will most likely come across the first active <span class="yellow">Starting Plate</span> or the <span class="yellow">Resonant Conductor</span> next to the <span class="yellow">Closing Plate</span> it leads to; this will be that team's pair of plates. After the other team kills the <span class="yellow">Overload Champion</span> a new Tormentor will spawn. Killing it will activate the plate in the room where the second <span class="yellow">Overload Champion</span> died, this will be the second set of <span class="yellow">Starting Plate</span> and <span class="yellow">Closing Plate/Conductor</span> needed to complete the cycle. The Team that killed the <span class="yellow">Overload Champion</span> in that room will be in charge of dealing with this set of plates.

                    <br><br>
                    After the second <span class="yellow">Tormentor</span> is dead and each team knows where their set of <span class="yellow">Starting</span> and <span class="yellow">Closing Plates</span> is, it is time to start the <span class="yellow">Resonace</span> generation with the plates.
                    The <span class="yellow">Starter Guardian</span> in each team will step on the <span class="yellow">Starting Plate</span>, the <span class="yellow">Closer Guardian</span> will return the ping and start the <span class="yellow">Plate Chain</span>. Both will keep the chain alive until all <span class="yellow">Sets of Resonance</span> (three total) have spawned.
                    <br><br>
                    The Ad-Clearers are free to pick up their resonance whenever they want from the center room. The Starter and Closer Guardians will need to pick up theirs between Plate pings, being careful not to neglect the plate for too long, or they may break the <span class="yellow">Plate Chain</span>.
                    <br><br>
                    When everyone on a team has picked up all their resonance (everyone should have x3 resonance), it is time to close the <span class="yellow">conductor</span>, the <span class="yellow">Closer Guardian</span> will shoot the triangle in the open conductor and successfully return a plate ping to close it.
                    <br><br>
                    When both teams (<span class="red">Wall</span> and <span class="green">Corner</span>) have closed their <span class="yellow">Conductor</span> a Mini-Boss Subjugator will spawn in the center room alongside a few extra ads. Killing every enemy in the room will respawn the <span class="yellow">Resonant Chest</span>, allowing everyone in the fireteam to dunk their resonance. 
                    <br><br>
                    Once everyone has dunked their resonance, the first cycle of three needed to end the encounter is complete.

                    The other two cycles will be exactly the same.

                            If you have the Stolen Valor buff, instead of the undefined rotating shape you will see either a triangle resonance shape or a circle resonance shape. Whichever you see is the one needed to close the Conductor.

                            <span class="yellowinf">Call to Reckoning</span> is the pre-buff for <span class="yellowinf">Stolen Valor</span>. 
                            <br><br>
                            To transform your <span class="yellowinf">Call to Reckoning</span> into <span class="yellowinf">Stolen Valor</span> all three selected guardians will need to have a small fight against the boss in the square arena.
                            <br><br>
                            When all three <span class="yellowinf">Called</span> guardians are ready, they will enter the boss arena, a weak spot on the boss's head will appear. Breaking the weak spot will spawn a small taken blight on top of the boss's head and bigger taken blights in the Square Arena and the Left, Mid, and Right areas. 
                            <br><br>
                            When all bigger taken blights have been destroyed the smaller blight on the boss head will disappear, the weak spot will appear again and destroying it for a second time will turn all the <span class="yellowinf">Call to Reckoning</span> buffs to <span class="yellowinf">Stolen Valor</span>.
                        </p>

                    Depending on when you want to handle the <span class="yellow">Call to Reckoning</span> buff, there are two strategies to complete the encounter.
                </p>
                <div class="info-box info-box-example">
                    <h3>Strat A: Plates Before Reckoning</h3>
                    <div class="info-box-content-wrap">
                        <p>
                            When one of the guardians gets the <span class="yellowinf">Call to Reckoning</span> buff, they will ignore it for now. 
                            <br><br>
                            When the Mini-Boss is dead, one of the Guardians will go to the Starting Plate, and the other one will stay at the Closing Plate. They will spawn all three resonance sets (one Triangle and one Circle for each set, making a total of six resonance, three for each Guardian in the team) and leave the resonance where they spawn without picking it up yet. All three teams should be doing this simultaneously.
                            <br><br>
                            When all teams are done spawning the resonace, the Called Guardian in each team will go to the boss fight to transform their buff. 
                            <br><br>
                            The Guardian that was not called will kill the Mini-Boss that respawns after the <span class="yellowinf">Plate Chain</span> breaks.
                            <br><br>
                            Once the Called Guardian has <span class="yellowinf">Stolen Valor</span>, they will go back to their area, take a look at the conductor, communicate to their partner which resonance type they need to close it, pick up all three of that resonance type, go to the Closing Plate and wait for the non-Called Guardian to ping from the Starting Plate so they can close.
                            <br><br>
                            <span class="greeninf">Pros</span>: Pinging the plates without having to worry about ads or picking up resonance in time between ping makes the encounter easier.
                            <br><br>
                            <span class="redinf">Cons</span>: If one or more of the teams is too slow with the plates, it may result in a delay for the Called Guardians' boss fight, making the mechanics portion of the encounter a bit slower.
                        </p>

                    <h3>Strat B: Plates After Reckoning</h3>
                    <div class="info-box-content-wrap">
                        <p>
                            As soon as the Guardian in each team gets the <span class="yellowinf">Call to Reckoning</span> buff, they go to the center arena and fight the boss to transform the buff into <span class="yellowinf">Stolen Valor</span>.
                            <br><br>
                            When they are finished with the fight, they will return to their area, take a look at the conductor, communicate which resonance they need to close the Conductor to their partner and stay at the bottom plate; they will be the Closer. 
                            <br><br>
                            The Guardian without <span class="yellowinf">Stolen Valor</span> will go to the top of the structure; they will be the Starter.
                            <br><br>
                            Both of them start pinging the plates to spawn the three resonances sets (one Triangle and one Circle for each set, making a total of six resonance, three for each Guardian in the team), pick up the resonance between pings and close the conductor with the correct resonance when all of it has been picked up.
                            <br><br>
                            <span class="greeninf">Pros</span>: This strategy is faster.
                            <br><br>
                            <span class="redinf">Cons</span>: Dealing with the enemies (specially the attendants) while pinging plates and trying to pick up resonance between pings makes the encounter considerably harder.
                        </p>
                    </div>
                </div>
                <p class="paragraph">
                    After all three teams close their Conductor, the resonant chest will spawn in the side of the square arena not connected to any of the areas. Every Guardian should dunk their resonance to extend the timer and get ready to fight the boss.
                    <br><br>
                    The damage phase starts when the square arena walls glow and lasts around 30 seconds. After that, if the boss has not reached Final Stand, the wall's glow will dim and a new cycle of mechanics will begin.

                    On Final Stand, the damage phase time will extend, and extra enemies will spawn in the boss arena until it is dead.

                    Every room is bigger than the previous one but all of them have the same layout: three starting plates near the entrance and three closing plates next to a conductor near the exit.

                    Starting Plates are connected to the Closing Plates via the wires, the connections between plates are more scrambled the further the room you are in.

                            Closer Players will always go to the Plate that matches their partner's ping (it will change between rooms).

                            Closer Guardians will collect the resonance their conductor needs to close from other sides, instead of picking up the resonance that their plate generates and closing another Closer guardian's conductor.

                    When the encounter starts all plates and conductors are deactivated, a <span class="blue">Boss Tormentor</span> will spawn near all the <span class="yellow">Closing Plates</span>, whoever gets the final blow on the <span class="blue">Tormentor</span> will receive the <span class="yellow">Stolen Valor</span> buff needed to know which resonance type closes the Conductor. Therefore, both players in a team should deal with <span class="blue">it</span> together, but the guardian in charge of the <span class="yellow">Starting Plate</span> must ensure that the Closer Guardian is the one to actually kill it.
                    <br><br>
                    Once the <span class="blue">Tormentor</span> is dead the plates and conductor on that side will activate. The Starter Guardian will go to the <span class="yellow">Starting Plate</span> on their side and the Closer Guardian will go to the <span class="yellow">Closing Plate</span> that matches that <span class="yellow">Starting Plate</span> ping. 
                    <br><br>
                    They will do the usual starting ping and three returning pings to spawn all resonance, but nobody picks it up yet. We will let the <span class="yellow">Plate Chain</span> break to give the Closer Guardian time to go get the resonance they need to close their Conductor, doing this will spawn a <span class="blue">Subjugator</span> near the <span class="yellow">Closing Plate</span>, but the Starter Guardian can easily go there and deal with it alone while their partner is away picking up the correct resonance.
                    <br><br>
                    Once the Closer Guardian has their resonance they will go back to their Conductor, the Starter Guardian should have killed the <span class="blue">Subjugator</span> already and returned to their <span class="yellow">Starting Plate</span> to pick up the resonance that spawned near it. When both are ready they will do a last ping to close the Conductor.
                    <br><br>
                    When all three sides Conductors are closed the <span class="yellow">Resonant Chest</span> will spawn and all Guardians should deposit their resonance to extend the timer. When everyone is resonance free an <span class="blue">Unstoppable Champion</span> alongside a few more ads will spawn near the exit door, killing it and all the ads will open the exit door.
                    <br><br>
                    Repeat the same process for all three rooms. The only difference between rooms is the size and the scrambled Plate pairing.

                                All Tormentors spawn very closely together, everyone should focus on killing all of them and whoever gets Stolen Valor should make a general callout of the resonance needed to close the Conductors from Left to Right

                            Before starting the encounter each guardian will need to make sure they have a distinctive armor set and ghost. Shaders don't matter for the armor, but they do work as a distinguishing factor for the ghost.

                            After you have made yourself stand out with your armor and ghost it is time to take notes of the rest of your fireteam members, these notes will make the Saving the Guardians mechanic a lot easier so keep them somewhere easily accessible during the encounter.

                    The room has three <span class="yellow">statues</span> that represent you and the other two guardians teleported to their own version of the Wall Zone, these three <span class="yellow">statues</span> will be holding a different <span class="yellow">2D shape</span> each (Triangle, Circle and Square). Guardian statues position and the shapes they hold are consistent across all three Inside rooms.
                    <br><br>
                    Your <span class="yellow">wall</span> will be rotating two <span class="yellow">shapes</span>: either two of the shape your statue is holding or one of the shape your guardian is holding and any of the other two.
                    <br><br>
                    This applies to every guardian teleported inside a Wall Zone room, making it a total of six shapes: two triangles, two circles and two squares, distributed between the three guardians' walls, two each.

                    For you to be able to get out, three conditions must be met:

                    2. You have traded the first two shapes you had on your wall when you were teleported to the room. It does not matter if one of those two shapes is given back to you, as long as you gave it away to another guardian first.
                </p>
                <p class="paragraph verity-condition condition-outside">
                    3. Your statue on the Outside is matching the 3D shape you are holding from Contition 1: this is the Outside Guardian's job, you don't have to worry about it.

                <p class="paragraph">
                    While Condition 3 depends on the Outside players, you do need to communicate to them the 2D shapes the statues you see are holding from Left to Right as soon as the encounter starts, they need this information to do their job.
                    <br><br>
                    The easiest way to fulfill the two conditions that deppend on you (1 and 2) is using what's known as the <i>Two of own, then distribute</i> strat. The strat is divided in two steps:

                        <p>
                            The goal of this first step is to make your wall rotate only the shape that your guardian's statue is holding. 
                            <br><br>
                            To accomplish this, every guardian that has a shape on their wall different than the one their statue is holding must kill the knight that drops it, grab it, and give it to the statue of the guardian that is actually holding it. 
                            <br><br>
                            If done correctly, everyone should have two of their own shape rotating on their wall, if you do, communicate it to your partners; everyone should finish this step before moving on to step 2.

                            You kill a knight and it drops the <span class="yellowinf">Triangle</span>. You want the <span class="yellowinf">Circle</span> to drop so you ignore it and kill the other knight, which will drop the <span class="yellowinf">Circle</span>.
                            <br><br>
                            You pick up the <span class="yellowinf">Circle</span>, find the statue that is holding it, and interact with it, giving it to the <span class="yellowinf">Circle Guardian</span>.

                            One of the other guardians would have a <span class="yellowinf">Triangle</span> on their wall that they don't need; they would do the same and deposit their <span class="yellowinf">Triangle</span> in your statue, giving it to you.

                            Once every guardian that got teleported to an inside room has two of the same shape on your wall (the one their statue is holding) you are ready for this step.
                            <br><br>
                            In this step, your goal is to give the other Inside Guardians your two shapes (one each).

                        <p>
                            Distributing from left to right makes it easier for you to remember which statue you have already distributed one of your shapes to and which one you haven't.
                            <br><br>
                            All you need to do now is wait for the other two guardians to do the same.
                            <br><br>
                            If everyone on the Inside does this correctly, you all will fulfill both Conditions 1 and 2:
                        </p>
                        <ul class="numbered">
                            <li>You got rid of the two shapes that match your statue's shape, making sure your wall rotates the two shapes that don't.</li>
                            <li>By this point, you have also already traded away both the shapes you had on your wall initially.</li>
                        </ul> 
                        <br>
                        <p>
                            Once your wall shows two shapes that are different from the one your statue is holding, kill the knights and pick up both shapes to create the 3D shape you need. If the Outside players have done their job correctly, you should be able to get out of the room through the glass.

                            The guardian whose statue is holding a <span class="yellowinf">Square</span> will give one of their two <span class="yellowinf">Squares</span> to you.

                            Your <span class="yellowinf">wall</span> will now have Circle > Square.

                            We kill the <span class="blueinf">knight</span> in the middle (because it is the one that drops the <span class="yellowinf">Triangle buff</span>), pick up the buff, and interact with the <span class="yellowinf">Left</span> statue; its pedestal will start to glow, meaning is waiting for you to dissect another shape to swap the <span class="yellowinf">Triangle</span> with.
                            <br><br>
                            We want the <span class="yellowinf">Triangle</span> to be replaced by a <span class="yellowinf">Square</span> to create a <span class="yellowinf">Cylinder</span>. We see that the statue on the <span class="yellowinf">Right</span> is holding a <span class="yellowinf">Prism</span> (Square + Triangle), and since the callout for that statue is <span class="yellowinf">S</span>, that means that it does not need that <span class="yellowinf">Square</span>. So, we kill the <span class="blueinf">knight</span> on the right (the one that drops the <span class="yellowinf">Square</span> buff) and interact with the statue.
                            <br><br>
                            The dissection process is done; the <span class="yellowinf">Triangle</span> we dissected from the statue on the <span class="yellowinf">Left</span> will swap with the <span class="yellowinf">Square</span> we dissected from the statue on the <span class="yellowinf">Right</span>.
                        </p>
                        <hr>
                        <p>
                            Now the statues look like this:
                        </p>
                        <ul class="info">
                            <li>Left is holding a Cylinder (Square + Circle). Done</li>
                            <li>Mid is holding a Cylinder (Circle + Square)</li>
                            <li>Right is holding a Pyramid (Triangle + Triangle)</li>
                        </ul>
                        <hr>
                        <p>
                            The Left callout was a <span class="yellowinf">T</span>, and the statue is holding a <span class="yellowinf">Cylinder</span>; we don't need to interact with that statue again, so let's focus on the other two.
                            <br><br>
                            The <span class="yellowinf">Mid</span> statue has a <span class="yellowinf">Cylinder</span>, and we want it to be a <span class="yellowinf">Prism</span>. We need to dissect a <span class="yellowinf">Circle</span> from it, so let's kill the last <span class="blueinf">knight</span> that is still alive (on the Left); it will drop the <span class="yellowinf">Circle</span> buff for us.
                            <br><br>
                            We will interact with the <span class="yellowinf">Mid</span> statue to dissect the <span class="yellowinf">Circle</span> from it. Its pedestal will start to glow.
                            <br><br>
                            Since all the <span class="blueinf">knights</span> are dead, two <span class="blueinf">unstoppable ogres</span> will spawn. The Ad-Clearers should kill them as soon as possible; that will make new <span class="blueinf">knights</span> respawn.
                            <br><br>
                            The shape that needs to replace the <span class="yellowinf">Circle</span> we just dissected is a <span class="yellowinf">Triangle</span>. The <span class="yellowinf">Right statue</span> has a <span class="yellowinf">Pyramid</span> (two triangles), and only needs one so let's kill the mid <span class="blueinf">knight</span>, grab the <span class="yellowinf">triangle</span> that it drops, and dissect it from the <span class="yellowinf">Right statue</span>.
                        </p>
                        <hr>
                        <p>
                            The shapes will swap, and the final state of each statue is:
                        </p>
                        <ul class="info">

                            While both <span class="redinf">Inside</span> and <span class="greeninf">Outside</span> guardians are doing their job, The Witness will interrupt the mechanics and kill all three of the <span class="redinf">Inside</span> guardians. 
                            <br><br>
                            Their <span class="yellowinf">ghosts</span> will spawn in the <span class="greeninf">Outside room</span>, available for the Outside guardians to pick up, one each.
                            <br><br>
                            The <span class="greeninf">Outside</span> guardians should quickly go through their notes before picking up a <span class="yellowinf">ghost</span> to know whose <span class="yellowinf">ghost</span> they are picking up, then go to the Spawn Zone and stand in front of the <span class="yellowinf">six statues</span>, waiting for one of the dead guardians to give them the combination of Guardian Name and Pedestal Position callout for the guardian whose <span class="yellowinf">ghost</span> they picked up. Dunk your <span class="yellowinf">ghost</span> in the pedestal when they do and go back to your job in the Wall Zone.
                            <br><br>
                            The <span class="redinf">Inside</span> guardian's cameras will stay in the Inside room. To be able to do the mechanics, they need to switch their death cam to spectate one of the alive guardians. When they grab a <span class="yellowinf">ghost</span> and go to the Spawn Zone, they will be able to see three non-glowing statues (alive guardians) and three <span class="yellowinf">glowing pedestals</span>, one of them with a <span class="yellowinf">statue</span>. Take a look at your notes, identify the guardian, and give the alive guardians a Guardian Name and Pedestal Number callout. When the guardian who grabbed your <span class="yellowinf">ghost</span> dunks it in the correct <span class="yellowinf">statue</span>, you will be back in your Inside Room.

                            After all the <span class="redinf">Inside</span> guardians leave their Inside rooms with their <span class="yellowinf">3D shapes</span>, the Imminent End timer will disappear, and a few minor ads alongside two <span class="blueinf">Unstoppable ogres</span> will spawn. Once all of them are dead, a new <span class="yellowinf">1-minute Imminent End timer</span> will appear, and <span class="yellowinf">5 guardians</span> will be calcified, leaving only <span class="yellowinf">1 guardian</span> alive to save them.
                            <br><br>
                            The mechanics are exactly the same for the dead guardians. You will see a <span class="yellowinf">statue</span> that represents one of the other calcified guardians in one of the <span class="yellowinf">glowing pedestals</span>; call it out by Guardian Name and Pedestal Position.
                            <br><br>
                            The alive guardian' job is easier this time; you don't need to go through your notes to make sure you are picking up the right <span class="yellowinf">ghost</span>. The dead guardians' <span class="yellowinf">ghosts</span> will be right next to their bodies, which still have the name tag above their heads. When you get a callout, look for the guardian's calcified body, pick up the <span class="yellowinf">ghost</span> that is near it, and dunk it in the called-out <span class="yellowinf">pedestal</span>. The dead guardian will be revived and can help you get the other <span class="yellowinf">ghosts</span> to their <span class="yellowinf">pedestals</span>.

                            The Witness arms that we saw and ignored during the first three encounters will be our source of it.
                            <br><br>
                            To get a specific type of resonance we will need to get inside the attack of the arm we want the resonance from:

                        <ul class="info">
                            <li>Triangle: Ceiling arm. Triangular attack that targets a guardian. Get inside the triangle before it explodes for a couple of seconds to get the resonance</li>
                            <li>Circle: Ground arm. Circular attack with a fixed spawn point. Get inside the circle for a couple of seconds before the bees kill you to get the resonance</li>
                            <li>Square: Wall arm. Horizontal beam parallel to the ground that targets a guardian. Get inside the beam area for a couple of seconds before the attack starts to get the resonance</li>

                        <p>
                            There is a sound cue that starts when you enter the attack and ends when you obtain the resonance.

                    If we look at the Witness we can see six glyphs (buttons) on their chest, our goal is to destroy all six buttons to start a damage phase.
                    <br>
                    To destroy a button we will need the <span class="yellow">Glyphbreaker</span> buff.

                            We will obtain the <span class="yellowinf">Glyphbreaker buff</span> as a reward for destroying one of the <span class="yellowinf">Witness arms</span>. To destroy an arm we need to shoot at its <span class="yellowinf">wrist</span> while being inside its attack and having a specific resonance-type buff.
                            <br><br>
                            To figure out which type of <span class="yellowinf">resonance</span> an <span class="yellowinf">arm</span> needs to break we will need to do a <span class="yellowinf">first wrist break</span> while being briefly inside its attack (we don't want to be inside the attack for too long; if we are, we might accidently get its <span class="yellowinf">resonance type</span>), that will destroy a surface layer of the <span class="yellowinf">wrist</span> revealing one of the next three colors:

                        <ul class="info">
                            <li>Red with square symbols: the arm needs <span class="yellowinf">Square resonance</span> to be destroyed</li>
                            <li>Green with triangle symbols: the arm needs <span class="yellowinf">Triangle resonance</span> to be destroyed</li>
                            <li>Yellow with elongated circle symbols: the arm needs <span class="yellowinf">Circle resonance</span> to be destroyed</li>

                            Once we know which <span class="yellowinf">resonance</span> an <span class="yellowinf">arm</span> needs to be broken we will go look for an <span class="yellowinf">arm</span> that gives us that type of <span class="yellowinf">resonance</span>, get inside its attack to get it and then come back to the <span class="yellowinf">initial arm</span> to break it while being inside its attack (again, a quick in and out should be enough to break the <span class="yellowinf">arm</span>; if we stay inside the attack for longer than needed, we will get its <span class="yellowinf">resonance</span> and overwrite the one we went to get to break it).
                            <br><br>
                            When the <span class="yellowinf">arm</span> breaks we will get the <span class="yellowinf">Glyphbreaker</span> buff.
                            <br><br>
                            You can only break one <span class="yellowinf">Witness glyph</span> with your <span class="yellowinf">Glyphbreaker buff</span>, to break more <span class="yellowinf">glyphs</span> you will need to reacquire it.

                            To cleanse you need to be standing in the <span class="yellowinf">pool of light</span> that is in the floating island in the center of the arena, when someone breaks a <span class="yellowinf">Witness glyph</span>, the pool will light up, and everyone inside it will be cleansed of resonance.
